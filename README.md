# Hi!

I’m a full-stack developer and media systems designer working across **editorial platforms**, **automated publishing workflows**, and **bespoke creative-coding tools**.

I build systems that help teams **author, transform, and publish** content reliably: data-driven websites, editorial scripting and automation, custom software utilities, and experimental digital media projects for communication/design agencies and culture/technology-focused organizations.

## What I work on
- **Editorial + publishing automation**: pipelines for structured content, templates, batch generation, exports, and reproducible publishing.
- **Content-driven web systems**: CMS-like architectures, data modeling, search/browse UX, and maintainable frontends.
- **Tooling**: small focused tools that reduce editorial friction (validation, formatting, conversion, QA).
- **Creative + experimental media**: prototypes and bespoke systems where infrastructure shapes the final form.

## How I like to work
- Practical systems thinking: **infrastructure → workflow → output quality**
- Simple interfaces over complex internals
- Reproducible builds, clear conventions, and documentation that’s actually usable

If you want to collaborate or talk publishing systems and automation, open an issue or reach out via LinkedIn.
